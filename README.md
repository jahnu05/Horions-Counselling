This repository contains the code for a WordPress website that offers counseling services. All `.html` files can be accessed by clicking on them or opening them in Chrome, as they are embedded in the WordPress website. Other pages were built directly within WordPress.

## Pages:

- **About Page:** Provides an introduction about the counselors.
- **Chat Page:** Allows users to chat with the chatbot.
- **Counseling Page:** Allows users to book forms.
- **Booking Forms:** Used to book a counseling session. The code for this is attached in the code files.
